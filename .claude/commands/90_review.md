# /90_review

_Review plans before implementation with comprehensive multi-angle analysis._

## Core Philosophy

- **Type-based review**: Customized for code/docs/scenario/infra/DB/AI plans
- **Mandatory + Extended + Autonomous**: Fixed items + type-specific + self-judgment
- **Proactive investigation**: Resolve "needs investigation" items upfront
- **Efficient progression**: Severity-based conditional checks

---

## Extended Thinking Mode

> **Conditional**: If LLM model is GLM, proceed with maximum extended thinking throughout all phases.

---

## Step 0: Load Plan

```bash
PLAN_PATH="$(ls -1tr .pilot/plan/in_progress/*/*.md .pilot/plan/pending/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
[ -z "$PLAN_PATH" ] && { echo "No plan found to review" >&2; exit 1; }
echo "Reviewing: $PLAN_PATH"
```

Read and extract: User requirements, Execution plan, Acceptance criteria, Test scenarios, Constraints, Risks

---

## Step 1: Proactive Investigation

> **Principle**: Investigate all "needs investigation/confirmation/review" items upfront

**Keywords**: "need to investigate", "confirm", "TODO", "check", "verify"

| Target | Method | Tools |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Existing code/patterns | Search similar impl | Glob, Grep, Read |
| API docs | Check official docs | WebSearch |
| Dependencies | npm/PyPI registry | Bash(npm/pip info) |

**Output**: `🔍 Investigation Complete: [Item] → Result: ✅/❌ Finding → Plan update: Applied`

---

## Step 2: Type Detection

| Type | Keywords | Extended Reviews |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Code** | function, component, API, bug fix | A, B, D |
| **Docs** | CLAUDE.md, README, guide | C |
| **Scenario** | test, validation, edge cases | H |
| **Infra** | Vercel, env, deploy, CI/CD | F |
| **DB** | migration, table, schema | E |
| **AI** | LLM, prompts, AI | G |

**Output**: `📋 Type: [Primary] / Extended: [A, B, D]`

---

## Step 3: Mandatory Reviews (8 items)

Execute all 8 reviews for every plan

### Review 1: Development Principles

## Step 4: Vibe Coding Compliance

> **NEW: Check Vibe Coding Guidelines enforcement**

| Target | Limit | Check |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Function | ≤50 lines | Plan mentions splitting large functions? |
| File | ≤200 lines | Plan respects module boundaries? |
| Nesting | ≤3 levels | Early return pattern specified? |

☐ **SRP**: One function = one responsibility?
☐ **DRY**: No duplicate code blocks planned?
☐ **KISS**: Simplest solution that works?
☐ **Early Return**: Reduced nesting planned?

---

## Step 5: Extended Reviews (By Type)

### Activation Matrix

| Type | Keywords | Activated Reviews |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Code Modification** | function, component, API, bug fix, refactor | A, B, D |
| **Documentation** | CLAUDE.md, README, guide | C |
| **Scenario Validation** | test, validation, scenario, edge cases | H |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, env, deploy, CI/CD | F |
| **DB Schema** | migration, table, column | E |

### Extended A: API Compatibility Review

**When**: Code modification plans

| Item | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Function Signature** | Do param changes break existing callers? |
| **Return Type** | Does return value change affect logic? |
| **Required vs Optional** | If new params are required, do callers need modification? |
| **Backward Compat** | Can existing behavior be maintained with defaults? |

**Process**:
1. List functions/APIs being changed
2. Search call sites using Grep
3. Verify each call site works after change

**Result Format**:
```
[Changed: functionName()]
- Original: (param1: Type1) => ReturnType
- Changed: (param1: Type1, param2?: Type2) => ReturnType
- Backward compatible: Yes/No
- Call site impact: N files
```

| **Test Coverage** | Are tests for new code in the plan? |
| **Mocking** | Is mocking needed for new deps? |

### Extended E: Migration Safety

**When**: DB schema plans

| Item | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Rollback** | Can we rollback if migration fails? |

## Step 6: Autonomous Review

> **Self-judge beyond mandatory/extended items**

**Perspectives**: Security (auth, validation), Performance (bottlenecks, caching), UX (loading, errors), Maintainability (readability), Concurrency (race conditions), Error Recovery (partial failure)

**Output**: `🧠 Autonomous Discoveries: [1: Perspective] Issue → Recommendation`

---

## Step 7: User-Requested Focus

If `"$ARGUMENTS"` contains focus areas, deep-dive:

| Focus | Areas |
|-------|-------|
| `security` | Auth, injection, XSS, sensitive data |
| `performance` | Queries, loops, caching, bundle size |
| `accessibility` | ARIA, keyboard, contrast, screen readers |
| `api` | Backward compatibility, versioning |
| `testing` | Coverage, edge cases, integration |

---

## Step 7.5: Gap Detection Review (MANDATORY)

> **🛑 BLOCKING Severity**: A new severity level higher than Critical
> - **BLOCKING** (🛑): Cannot proceed, triggers Interactive Recovery in `/01_confirm`
> - **Critical** (🚨): Must fix before execution
> - **Warning** (⚠️): Should fix
> - **Suggestion** (💡): Nice to have

### Review 9: Gap Detection (MANDATORY)

> **Purpose**: Detect vague specifications that prevent independent executor work
> **Activation**: Run for ALL plans, but only report BLOCKING when external service keywords detected

**Trigger Keywords**: `API`, `fetch`, `call`, `endpoint`, `database`, `migration`, `SDK`, `HTTP`, `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `async`, `await`, `timeout`, `env`, `.env`

#### 9.1 External API Verification
☐ All API calls have implementation mechanism (SDK vs HTTP)?
☐ All "Existing" endpoints verified to exist in codebase?
☐ All "New" endpoints have creation tasks in Execution Plan?
☐ Error handling strategy defined for each external call?

**Automated Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Endpoint existence check
grep -r "endpoint_path" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx"

# SDK dependency check
grep "package_name" package.json

# Environment variable check
grep "VAR_NAME" .env .env.example .env.local 2>/dev/null
```

#### 9.2 Database Operation Verification
☐ Schema changes have migration files specified?
☐ Rollback strategy documented?
☐ Data integrity checks included?

#### 9.3 Async Operation Verification
☐ Timeout values specified for all async operations?
☐ Concurrent operation limits defined?
☐ Race condition scenarios addressed?

#### 9.4 File Operation Verification
☐ File paths are absolute or properly resolved?
☐ File existence checks present before operations?
☐ Cleanup strategy defined for temporary files?

#### 9.5 Environment Verification
☐ All new env vars documented in .env.example?
☐ All referenced env vars exist in current environment?
☐ No actual secret values in plan?

#### 9.6 Error Handling Verification
☐ No silent catches (console.error only)?
☐ User notification strategy for each failure mode?
☐ Graceful degradation paths defined?

**BLOCKING Finding Format**:
```markdown
### 🛑 BLOCKING (Must resolve before proceeding)
- **[External API]** API mechanism unspecified - missing SDK/HTTP, endpoint, error handling
  - Location: "Call GPT 5.1 for analysis" in User Requirements
  - Required: Specify SDK package (e.g., `openai@4.x`) or HTTP endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/analyze`)
```

## Step 9: Apply Findings to Plan

> **Principle**: Review completion = Plan file improved with findings applied

### 9.1 Map Findings to Sections

| Issue Type | Target Section | Method |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Missing step | Execution Plan | Add checkbox |
| Unclear requirement | User Requirements / Success Criteria | Clarify wording |
| Test gap | Test Plan | Add scenario |
| Risk identified | Risks & Mitigations | Add item |
| Alternative approach | How (Approach) | Add/modify |
| Scope issue | Scope (In/Out) | Adjust scope |

### 9.2 Apply & Update History

1. Read plan file
2. For each finding: Identify target section, Apply modification, Track change
3. Write updated plan

**Error Handling**: If error, keep original intact, log to History

**Append to Review History**:
```markdown
## Review History

### Review #N (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

**Findings Applied**:
| Type | Count | Applied |
|------|-------|---------|
| Critical | N | N |
| Warning | N | N |
| Suggestion | N | N |

**Changes Made**:
1. **[Type] Section - Item**
   - Issue: [Description]
   - Applied: [Change made]
```

---

## Success Criteria

| Criteria | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Auto-proceed | BLOCKING 0 + Critical 0 + Warning ≤1 |
| User confirmation | BLOCKING ≥1 OR Critical ≥1 OR Warning ≥2 |
| BLOCKED | BLOCKING ≥1 (triggers Interactive Recovery in `/01_confirm`) |

> **🛑 BLOCKING Threshold**: Any BLOCKING finding prevents execution until resolved via Interactive Recovery (in `/01_confirm`) or `--lenient` flag is used.
